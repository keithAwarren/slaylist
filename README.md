Hello! My Name is Keith.

I am a beginner web developer from Canada.

This project is called Slaylist. It is a web app developed in React using Visual Studio Code.

Most of the project is written in JavaScript/JSX and CSS, utilizing react's library for faster performance and smoother output.

The idea for the project came from how unintuitive a few of my peers found building playlists in Spotify can be.

This project allows a simple interface for building a playlist and saving it to your Spotify account on one page.

This project was a challenge for myself to learn how to get information from established APIs.

It uses the implicit grant flow method of authorizing Spotify accounts which was in my opinion the easiest to establish, albeit limiting.

I plan on expanding it's capabilities in order to retrieve playlists from a user's account in order to update them live,
not unlike jukebox apps that allow patrons at a bar to choose a song to add to a concurrently playling playlist at bars/restaurants.

It is currently hosted on slaylist.netlify.app
